# Getting Started with MetaMask and Voting

Welcome to the world of blockchain and voting! This guide will walk you through the process of setting up a MetaMask wallet and participating in the voting process. We'll keep it simple and easy to follow, so let's get started!

## Step 1: Install MetaMask

1. Open your preferred web browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Brave) and navigate to the MetaMask website at [https://metamask.io/](https://metamask.io/).

2. Click on the "Download" button and select the browser extension that corresponds to your web browser.

3. Click "Add to Chrome" (or the equivalent button for your browser) and confirm the installation. MetaMask will now be added to your browser.

## Step 2: Create a MetaMask Wallet

1. Open the MetaMask extension by clicking on the fox icon in your browser's toolbar.

2. Click on "Get Started" and then "Create a Wallet".

3. Agree to the terms and conditions and create a strong password for your wallet.

4. MetaMask will display a secret backup phrase. Write it down on a piece of paper and store it securely. This phrase is essential for recovering your wallet if needed.

5. Confirm your secret backup phrase by selecting the words in the correct order.

## Step 3: Configure MetaMask to use the Sepolia Test Network

1. Click on the network dropdown at the top of the MetaMask window (it may say "Ethereum Mainnet" by default).

2. Select "Sepolia Test Network" from the list of networks.

## Step 4: Share Your Wallet Address

1. In MetaMask, click on your account name to copy your wallet address to the clipboard.

2. Share this address with me so that I can send you a NOTD NFT.

## Step 5: Vote on the Website

1. Once you have received the NOTD NFT in your MetaMask wallet, visit my voting website.

2. Connect your MetaMask wallet to the website by clicking on the MetaMask icon in your browser and approving the connection request.

3. You should now see the voting options on the website. Click on the "Vote" button next to your desired headline to cast your vote.

4. To vote, you'll need SepoliaETH, which is the test network's native currency. You can request test ETH from a faucet like [https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/ethereum-sepolia](https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/ethereum-sepolia).

That's it! You're now ready to participate in the blockchain voting process. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to reach out.
